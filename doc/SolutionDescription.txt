Assumptions:

The solution is implemented as ConsoleApplication and the report is presented in console window.
By default street1.txt file from execution directory is processed (has to be copied there).
It is possible to specify file name as a parameter, to display a result for another file.


Solution:

.Net Framework 4.5.2 and C# 6.0 (requires VisualStudio 2015)
NuGet packages will be downloaded on build


Projects:

Valtech.PaperRound - 	console application, responsible for running application and setting up IoC container. Contains ConsoleReportPresenter which is implementation of IReportPresenter
			displaying report in a console window.



Valtech.PaperRound.Core - class library where most of the logic is located. Designed to be easily extensible. It's possible to provide different implementation of IReportPresenter
			to be able to present report in a different way (eg. by email or output file). It's also possible to provide another IDeliveryStrategy, other than these
			in acceptance criteria ("North first" and "In Turn from West to East"). There is also IReportProvider interface allowing to extend report with another data part 
			other than street specification data (Story1) and delivery strategy data (Story2). Street specification validation is not extensible as I assume there are general
			rules regarding house numbers that are not likely to change. This logic is a part of StreetSpecification class, following DDD principles and avoiding AnimicDomainModel
			(http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html - Martin Fowler)



Valtech.PaperRound.Core.Test - unit tests for Core project. Using Nunit, Moq and AutoFixture
